# Python for SRE/DevOps Bootcamp - Chapter: Network Interactions

Welcome to the **Network Interactions** chapter of your 90-day Python bootcamp! This section is dedicated to mastering how Python communicates across networks, a cornerstone for managing distributed systems, cloud infrastructure, and remote services in an SRE/DevOps role.

## Chapter Overview

This chapter focuses on equipping you with the Python skills necessary to perform network health checks, interact with remote services, and build robust tools for network-aware automation. We'll transition from local system interactions to understanding and manipulating network connectivity.

## Topics Covered (Beginning Day 19)

### Day 19: Basic Network Connectivity & Sockets
* **Focus:** Understanding fundamental network concepts and checking basic host/port reachability.
* **Key Concepts:**
    * IP Addresses, Ports, and essential protocols (TCP/UDP).
    * The Client-Server Model.
    * Using Python's built-in `socket` module to perform precise port connectivity checks.
    * Setting connection timeouts and implementing robust error handling for network operations.
* **SRE/DevOps Relevance:** Vital for service health checks, firewall troubleshooting, deployment verification, and basic network diagnostics.

## Key Skills You Will Gain (So far in this Chapter)

Upon completing the initial lessons in this chapter, you will be able to:
* Understand core networking concepts relevant to SRE/DevOps.
* Perform basic network reachability tests to hosts and specific service ports.
* Utilize Python's `socket` module for low-level network connectivity checks.
* Implement robust timeout and error handling for network connection attempts.
* Apply network connectivity checks for automated health monitoring and troubleshooting.
