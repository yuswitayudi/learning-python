# Python Fundamentals for SRE/DevOps - Day 14: Error Handling (Part 1) - Specific Exceptions (Approx. 20 Minutes)

**Focus:** Learning to anticipate and manage errors gracefully when interacting with infrastructure, APIs, and data, a cornerstone of reliable SRE/DevOps automation.

**Why is Error Handling Essential in SRE/DevOps?**
In SRE/DevOps, your Python scripts are constantly interacting with external, often unpredictable, systems: remote servers, cloud APIs, network devices, log files, configuration databases. These interactions frequently fail due to:
* **Network Issues:** A server is unreachable, connection timeouts.
* **Invalid Data:** A configuration file is malformed, an API returns unexpected JSON.
* **Resource Unavailability:** A file isn't found, a port is already in use.
* **Permission Problems:** Your script doesn't have the necessary rights to read/write a file or execute a command.

Proper error handling ensures your automation scripts don't just crash. Instead, they can log the issue, retry, alert an SRE team, or degrade gracefully, preventing service outages or manual intervention.

**Concepts & Explanation (Estimate: 15-18 Minutes)**

1.  **Recap: Basic `try-except` (2 minutes)**
    * The `try` block contains code that **might raise an exception** (an error).
    * The `except` block contains code that **executes only if an exception occurs** within the `try` block.

    **SRE/DevOps Relevance:** This is your first line of defense against unexpected script termination when, for instance, attempting a network call or file operation.

2.  **Handling Specific Exceptions (8 minutes)**
    * Instead of a generic `except` (which can hide real bugs), explicitly name the exception type you expect to catch.
    * You can have multiple `except` blocks to handle different types of errors with tailored responses.
    * A generic `except Exception as e:` (catch-all) can be used *after* specific ones to log or catch unexpected issues, where `e` contains the error message.

    **SRE/DevOps Relevance:** This is crucial for *diagnosability*. Distinguishing between a "network connection lost" error and a "malformed data" error lets you trigger the right alert, provide precise feedback, or execute different recovery logic.

3.  **Accessing Exception Information (5 minutes)**
    * Using `except ExceptionType as e:` allows you to capture the actual exception object. Printing `e` gives you the default error message, which is invaluable for logging and debugging.

    **SRE/DevOps Relevance:** When an automation script fails, the exception message (and often a full stack trace, though we're compacting here) is the first piece of information you need to diagnose the problem quickly.
