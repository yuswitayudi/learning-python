# Python Fundamentals for SRE/DevOps - Day 1

This mini-README summarizes the foundational Python concepts covered in our first "bootcamp" session, specifically geared towards Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) and DevOps professionals who are beginning or refreshing their Python skills.

## Key Concepts Covered:

* **Basic Syntax:** Understanding the fundamental rules of Python syntax, including:
    * Variable assignment (`variable_name = value`).
    * Basic data types (integers, floats, strings, booleans).
    * Operators (arithmetic: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//`, `%`, `**`; comparison: `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`; logical: `and`, `or`, `not`).
    * Control flow statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`, `for` loop, `while` loop) and the crucial role of **indentation** in defining code blocks.
* **Printing Output:** Using the `print()` function to display information to the console.
    * Printing basic values (`print("Hello")`, `print(123)`).
    * Printing multiple items with automatic spacing (`print("Name:", name, "Age:", age)`).
    * **Formatted String Literals (f-strings):** A modern and readable way to embed expressions and variables directly within strings (`print(f"Hostname: {hostname}, IP: {ip}")`).

## Why This is Important for SRE/DevOps:

A solid understanding of these Python fundamentals is crucial for:

* **Scripting and Automation:** Writing scripts to automate repetitive tasks, manage infrastructure, and deploy applications.
* **Interacting with APIs:** Handling data returned in various formats.
* **Data Processing:** Manipulating and analyzing system metrics, logs, and configuration data.
* **Building Custom Tools:** Creating small utilities to aid in monitoring, troubleshooting, and management.
