# Python Fundamentals for SRE/DevOps - Day 5: Introduction to Lists

This README summarizes the introduction to Python Lists, a fundamental data structure for handling ordered collections of items, particularly relevant for SRE and DevOps workflows.

## Key Concepts Covered:

* **What are Lists?**
    * Ordered collections of items.
    * Mutable (their contents can be changed).
    * Can contain items of different data types.
    * Defined using square brackets `[]` with comma-separated items.
* **Creating Lists:**
    * Creating empty lists (`[]`).
    * Creating lists with various data types (numbers, strings, booleans, mixed types, nested lists).
* **Accessing Elements (List Indexing):**
    * Accessing individual elements using zero-based indexing (e.g., `my_list[0]`).
    * Using negative indexing to access elements from the end (e.g., `my_list[-1]`).
* **List Slicing:**
    * Extracting portions of a list using `[start:end]` notation, similar to string slicing.
    * Creating new lists containing a subset of the original list's elements.
* **Mutability of Lists:**
    * Understanding that lists are mutable, allowing direct modification of elements by assigning new values to specific indices.
